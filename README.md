# Fortran-Library
Nonlinear optimization, linear algebra, and more 

To see what this library is capable of conveniently, you may open each source file and simply fold all: routines are categorized and folded into different sections.

This library depends on BLAS & LAPACK & MKL. You will have to compile together with MKL_RCI.f90, which can be found in your MKL installation path

Main.f90 and makefile are to build a demo program, testing the functionality.
